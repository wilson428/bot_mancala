# Mancala Bot

A simulation of the standard American version of Mancala, including logic for a computer opponent.

## Ethical Agreement

By cloning or forking this repo, you solemnly agree that you will not use it as aid while actively playing a human without disclosing that you're getting a little help from a computer. The purpose of this simulation is to learn strategies on your own time or develop a bot for others to practice against. Mancala is a wonderful game that should not be taken over by machines.
